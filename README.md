# Task 3-Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier 

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features.

## âœ… Objective

To build a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no) based on various features such as age, job, marital status, balance, and more.

## âœ… Process Overview

### 1. Data Loading
Loaded bank-full.csv dataset using pandas.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
### 3. Train-Test Split
Dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
### 4. Model Building
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
### 5. Evaluation
Evaluated the model using Accuracy Score ,confusion mattix and Classification Report.
Visualized the top levels of the decision tree using plot_tree().
## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy Score: 87.36%

Confusion Matrix: [[7382   570] [  567   524]]
